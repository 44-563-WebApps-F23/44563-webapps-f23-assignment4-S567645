                <h1>Sumedh Appanagari acts in a play</h1>
                <h2>An Enemy of the people act 1 by Henrick Ibsen</h2>

                <p>Mrs. Stockmann</p>  
                <p>(smiling)</p>
                <p>Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
                    spendthrifts.</p>

                <p>Peter Stockmann<br>
                    Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.</p>
                 <p>(Points to the Doctor's study.)</p>
                 <p>Is he not at home?</p> 

                 <p>Mrs. Stockmann</p>
                 <p>No, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and
                    the boys.</p>

                <p>Peter Stockmann<br>
                    I doubt if that is a wise thing to do.</p>
                <p>(Listens.)</p>
                <p>I fancy I hear him coming now.</p>

                <p>Mrs. Stockmann<br>
                    No, I don't think it is he.</p>
                <p>(A knock is heard at the door)</p>
                <p>Come in!</p> 
                <p>(HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.)</p> 
                <p>Oh, it is you, Mr.Hovstad!</p>
                
                <p>Hovstad<br>
                    Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the
                       printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor.</p>

                <p>Peter Stockmann<br>
                    <p>(bowing a little distantly)</p> 
                <p> Good evening. You have
                    come on business, no doubt.
                    </p>  
                    
                <p>Hovstad<br>
                    Partly. It's about an article for the paper.</p>
                 
                 <p>Peter Stockmann<br>
                    So I imagined. I hear my brother has become a prolific
                       contributor to the "People's Messenger."</p> 
                       
                 <p>Hovstad<br>
                    Yes, he is good enough to write in the "People's Messenger"
                      when he has any home truths to tell.</p> 
                      
                 <p>Mrs. Stockmann</p>
                 <p>(to HOVSTAD)</p>
                 <p>But won't you—?</p>
